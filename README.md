# Week-Four-Challenge-Javascript-Quiz!

Javascript Quiz created by Jeremy C. Collins. This is my week four challenge to make a quiz using Javascript. This quiz, includes features that allow users to start the quiz, answer questions (relating to Javascript), and save their final score! There is a timer that counts down to 0, but be careful not to answer the wrong question, or you  will be penalized and lose time on the clock! It will save the user and score to the localStorage, and display the most recent 10 scores to the "highscores!" page.
